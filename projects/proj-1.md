title: 'Smart Bin for Garbage Segregation'
---
We produce unbelievable amounts of garbage and still do not have proper measures
in place to deal with it. The amount of waste generated has tripled since 1960. This has
led to devastating effects for the environment. This project aims to reduce the impact of garbage on
this problem by segregating waste into different categories with our Smart Garbage Bin. This
task is usually carried out by hand and automating it would greatly help reduce the costs and
time to recycle items.
